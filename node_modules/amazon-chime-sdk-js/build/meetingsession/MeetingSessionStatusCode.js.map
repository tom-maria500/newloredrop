Other functions that use [[MeetingSessionStatus]] (mainly\n * `AudioVideoControllerFacade.promoteToPrimaryMeeting` and `AudioVideoObserver.audioVideoWasDemotedFromPrimaryMeeting` will document\n * their usage separately).\n *\n * These status codes can be used for logging, debugging, and notification to end users, but in most cases should not\n * be used for any retry behavior, as the audio video controller will already be retrying non-terminal errors (i.e. regardless\n * of `MeetingSessionStatus.isTerminal`, your application should not try to immediately restart or recreate the\n * audio video controller). For error codes that indicate issues with the Chime service, please create a github issue\n * with browser logs if they occur frequently.\n *\n * If `MeetingSessionStatus.isTerminal` returns `true`, you should remove any meeting UX in addition to notifying the user,\n * as the audio video controller will not be retrying the connection. When notifying users, more general failure messages are\n * recommended unless otherwise noted.\n */\nexport enum MeetingSessionStatusCode {\n  /**\n   * There is no error.
